In this project, you’re given a text file with chess tournament results where the information has some structure. Your
job is to create an R Markdown file that generates a .CSV file (that could for example be imported into a SQL database)
with the following information for all of the players:
Player’s Name, Player’s State, Total Number of Points, Player’s Pre-Rating, and Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents
For the first player, the information would be:
Gary Hua, ON, 6.0, 1794, 1605

*Note that for this project we provide the R code in whole, rather than in bits and pieces via the markdown.*

```{r}
#Clear the environment - just make things neater
rm(list=ls())

#Load the necessary libraries
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
theUrl <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kennygfm/IS607/master/tournamentinfo.txt"
raw <- read.table(theUrl,header=FALSE,sep="\n")

#We know the first 4 rows are irrelvant
nr <- nrow(raw)
raw <- data.frame(raw[5:nr,])

nr <- nrow(raw)-2

#Define the data frame that will host the tournament information
players <- data.frame(id = numeric(0), name = character(0), state = character(0), points = numeric(0), rating = numeric(0), opponents = character(0), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Our first step is to read in all of the data, and enter it into a dataframe
#Note that for purposes beyond the project we would creatae function to do this
for(i in 1:nr)
{
  top_row <- as.character(raw[i,])
  second_row <- as.character(raw[i+1,])
  
  #Cull the ID
  pair_id <- str_extract(top_row, "[:space:]+[:digit:]+|")
  pair_id <- as.numeric(str_extract(pair_id,"[[:digit:]]+"))
  
  if (is.na(pair_id)) {
    pair_id <- top_row
    next
  }
  #Cull the name
  pname <- str_extract(top_row, "[[:alpha:]].+?[|]")
  pname <- str_trim(str_replace_all(pname,"[|]",""))
  
  #Cull the state
  state <- str_extract(second_row, "[[:alpha:]].+?[|]")
  state <- str_trim(str_replace_all(state,"[|]",""))
  
  #Cull the total number of points
  points <- str_extract(top_row, "[|][:digit:][:punct:][:digit:]")
  points <- str_trim(str_replace_all(points,"[|]",""))
  
  #Cull the Pre-rating
  rating <- str_extract(second_row,"R:[:space:]+[:digit:]+")
  rating <- as.numeric(str_extract(rating,"[[:digit:]]+"))
  
  #Cull the IDs of the opponents
  opponents <- as.character(str_extract_all(top_row,"[WDL]{1}[:space:]+[:digit:]+"))
  
  #Fill the dataframe
  players <- rbind(players,data.frame(id=pair_id, name=pname, state=state, points=points, rating=rating, opponents=opponents))
}
#Convert factors back to characters
i <- sapply(players, is.factor)
players[i] <- lapply(players[i], as.character)

#Our next step is to calculate the average score of the opponents. 
#Again, beyond this project we would make this into a separate function
nr <- nrow(players)
for(i in 1:nr) {
  opponents <- unlist(str_extract_all(players[i,'opponents'], "[WDL]{1}[:space:]+[:digit:]+"))
  
  o_total <- 0
  for(j in 1:length(opponents)) {
    o_id <- as.numeric(str_extract(opponents[j],"[[:digit:]]+"))
    o_rating <- players[players$id==o_id, 'rating']
    o_total <- o_total + o_rating
  }
  o_average <- round(o_total / length(opponents), digits = 0)
  players[i,'opponents'] <- as.character(o_average)
}
players <- players[,-1] 
write.csv(players, file = "Project1.csv")
kable(players, digits = getOption("digits"), caption = "Players Table", escape = TRUE)
